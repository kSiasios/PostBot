1: One of my favourite Black Sabbath songs. Still posted by a bot.
2: Nightstalker is the only greek band in this list and this is a song that is stuck in my head.
3: One of the most iconic rock bands couldn't be absent from this list.
4: The first Rolling Stones song that I ever listened two.
5: DK is the band that introduced me to the Punk Rock scene with this song. Well deserved place in this list.
6: Even though this is not Nirvana's most popular song, it is the one that I like the most. By the way, this is still a bot.
7: This song, released in 2005, is still relevant.
8: Just Metallica!
9: This is the last song this bot will post. Suitable title, don't you think?
